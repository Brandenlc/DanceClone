DanceClone
------------------------
DanceClone is a DDR clone allowing people with gamecube-style dance mats
to play stepmania-compatible files.  Simply copy your mp3 and steps 
exported in .sm format (from DDreamStudio for example) onto your SD card.

It uses SDL and runs on the Nintendo Wii using the Wiibrew channel.
It also runs on Linux for testing and development purposes (keyboard only).

This source code is distributed under GNU LGPL, which can be
found in the file "COPYING".

The original code for DanceClone version 0.50 by ThatOtherPerson.
