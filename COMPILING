---
As of 0.51 the source code should compile the Wii version of DanceClone under debian linux with the following dependencies:
devkitppc r24

SDLwii 1.2

--the following files were used on an Ubuntu 10.04LTS workstation to compile the source:

devkitPPC_r24-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
libogc-1.8.8.tar.bz2
libpng-1.5.4-ppc.tar.bz2
freetype-2.4.2-ppc.tar.bz2
jpeg8a-ppc.tar.bz2
tremor-lowmem-ppc.tar.bz2
libfat-ogc-1.0.10.tar.bz2
zlib-1.2.5-ppc.tar.bz2

SDL from source.

note SDL source was finicky to compile, check LIBOGC in the wii_rules
and make sure dependencies are correctly located

Information about setting up the correct build environment can be found at

The aim is to cross-compile a boot.dol file executable natively by the Wii.

First install v0.50 of DanceClone available at http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Dance_Clone which will give you the installed application and the necessary resources.
